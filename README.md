  * There are 6 kinds of figure skating jumps such as Axel, Flip, Salchow, Lutz, Toeloop, Loop in our dataset.  

* Model  
  * We use LSTM architecture to analyze our dataset.
  * The LSTM code is from : https://github.com/SBoyNumber1/LSTM-video-classification

* Body skeleton
  * OpenPose : https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose

* GUI 
  * We built our GUI by PyQt5.  
  * Uploading jump clips to analyze. 
  * Saving analyzed clips to related category.
  * We have audio guide(Mandarin) corresponding to jumps.
